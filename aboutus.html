    <p class = "clear">We are a group of highschool students who really love to eat. We experienced times where we ate good, and times where we just ate to satisfy. Nonetheless, we wanted to share what we loved with other people, which was eating a good and satisfying meal.
      <br>
      <br>
      One day, we saw my friend from school, begging to his knees just for some food. We agreed to put in a few pesos to buy him a 2pc chicken meal from Jollibee. He was so happy and we really saw the smile on his face. This gave us an idea to create Eat Good, Do Good.
