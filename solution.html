    <h1 class="floattxt">Increased access to nutritional food.</h1>
    <section id = "clear">To help solve malnutrition in this generation, we could make healthier food more affordable. Making healthy food more affordable gives more choices for the less-fortunate families to choose much more nutritional options instead of cheap canned goods that could harm a child’s growth. Nutritious food could help lessen the commonality of vitamin and nutrient deficiencies. To get all this food, we must support farmers, as they have direct access to these types of food which could benefit our nation. We could help support local farmers to increase availability of fresh goods in the communities. If ever healthy food becomes much more accessible to the public, we could guarantee that malnutrition rates will decrease for everyone can eat much more nutritious food. If we increase access to these types of food, we could build a stronger and much healthier population. </p>

      <p>Not only can malnutrition affect one’s physical development, it can also cause a hindrance in cognitive development. This can harm one’s academic performance as when cognitive development is slower, it tends to make the person have extreme difficulty in listening, understanding, and remembering lessons taught in class. It can affect one’s ability to participate a lot in class because their bodies do not have enough energy to keep themselves awake in class. Many hungry students could also miss class more because their body cannot defend sicknesses properly, keeping them at home trying to recover from sickness. When this happens, their learning becomes inconsistent which could affect their confidence over time. This could lead to the student falling behind in their classes and lose the motivation to study properly simply because they don’t have enough confidence that they could listen and understand the lesson.</p>
