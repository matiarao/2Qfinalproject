    <h1 class="floattxt">Malnutrition and Poor Health</h1>
    <section id = "clear">When a child does not eat enough food, they tend to become malnourished. Malnutrition is a very big problem as it weakens the body because the body cannot get the essential nutrients to support the body’s growth and protection through the immune system. A child who is malnourished tends to experience growth stunting, being underweight, and infections like pneumonia and diarrhea. Because of the child’s immune system becoming weaker due to malnourishment, even minor sicknesses are capable to kill a child simply because their bodies’ immune system cannot fight back the sickness. IF ever a child is exposed to prolonged malnourishment, it can delay a lot of the physical development. This puts the risk of death at a young age much higher. If ever malnourishment is still a big problem, it could harm future generations and potentially limit their nation’s progress in human development </p>

    <h1 class="floattxt">Poor Academic Performances</h1>
    <section id = "clear">
      <p>Not only can malnutrition affect one’s physical development, it can also cause a hindrance in cognitive development. This can harm one’s academic performance as when cognitive development is slower, it tends to make the person have extreme difficulty in listening, understanding, and remembering lessons taught in class. It can affect one’s ability to participate a lot in class because their bodies do not have enough energy to keep themselves awake in class. Many hungry students could also miss class more because their body cannot defend sicknesses properly, keeping them at home trying to recover from sickness. When this happens, their learning becomes inconsistent which could affect their confidence over time. This could lead to the student falling behind in their classes and lose the motivation to study properly simply because they don’t have enough confidence that they could listen and understand the lesson.</p>

  <section id = "problem3">
     <h1 class="floattxt">Low Productivity and Poverty Cycle</h1>
    <section id = "clear">Malnutrition can not only happen in children, but also in adults. When adults don’t get enough food, they become much weaker and cannot work effectively like they used to. The reduced energy they have makes it harder for them to finish tasks, much more stay productive throughout their day at work. With this, consequences like lower income makes it much harder to afford proper meals that could help them recover that energy back. If they cannot solve this, the cycle of not eating to working poorly will repeat. Not only is this risking their own health, but also their family’s health will start to decline, as they cannot be provided with proper food. This would leave their children hungry, which could also affect their academic performance. If this continues, generations will be trapper in poverty and families would stay stagnant and not improve in terms of their quality of life.</p>
